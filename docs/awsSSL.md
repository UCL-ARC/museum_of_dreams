# Setting up SSL on AWS

This document assumes you have purchased a domain name.

### Creating the certificates etc
Go to [AWS Route 53](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/home?region=eu-west-2#Dashboard) and create a new public hosted zone in the same region that you set the EB app up in (eu-west-2 in our case).

Wherever you purchased your domain, make sure to add the name servers generated by your new hosted zone.

Then go to [AWS Certificate Manager](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home) and request a new certificate for your domain with a * for a wildcard before the domain name. Everything can be left as standard.

**Once the certificate has been issued, i.e *not* pending** click on the certificate and click "create records in Route 53". Select applicable domain names and create records, they should show up in your Hosted Zone.

### Attaching to the EB environment
