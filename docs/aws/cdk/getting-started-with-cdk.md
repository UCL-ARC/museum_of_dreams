# Getting started with AWS CDK

Once these are in place, you can start working by:

```bash
$ cd infrastructure # ensures that you are working from the cdk project directory

# installing the python cdk libraries
$ pip install -r requirement.txt
$ pip install -r requirement-dev.txt
```

The `cdk` command should be now callable in your terminal given you are in the correct working directory.

## Note

For the Museum of Dreamworlds Project, the cdk directory would be `/infrastructure`. In other cases, it will usually be where app.py is located in your cdk project.
